# BentoML

BentoML is an open-source platform for serving, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models in production environments. BentoML supports a variety of machine learning frameworks and provides a flexible, developer-friendly way to package models, create inference services, and deploy them across diverse environments, including cloud services, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Supports popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and more.
- **Model Serving**: Easily turn trained models into REST or gRPC APIs with a minimal setup.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy models to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-premises, or within Docker and Kubernetes environments.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Track request/response metrics, monitor performance, and integrate with observability tools for production monitoring.
- **Scalable and High-Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput, with built-in support for load balancing and autoscaling.

## Installation

To get started with BentoML, install it via pip:

```bash
pip install bentoml
```

## Quick Start

1. **Package a Model**

   - Train a model and save it using your preferred framework.
   - Package the model with BentoML’s `bentoml.save_model()` method.

2. **Define a Service**

   - Define an inference API by creating a Python file with BentoML’s `@bentoml.api` decorator.
   
   ```python
   import bentoml
   from bentoml.io import JSON

   # Example of loading a model and defining an API
   model = bentoml.models.get("your_model:latest")
   
   @bentoml.api(input=JSON(), output=JSON())
   def predict(input_data):
       # Add model inference logic here
       return model.predict(input_data)
   ```

3. **Serve Locally**

   - Start a local development server to test your model endpoint:
   
   ```bash
   bentoml serve service:predict
   ```

4. **Deploy to Production**

   - Use BentoML’s deployment tools to containerize your model and deploy it on cloud services, Kubernetes, or as a standalone Docker container:
   
   ```bash
   bentoml build
   bentoml containerize service
   ```
